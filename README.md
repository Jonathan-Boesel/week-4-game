# week-4-game

A simple click based RPG game made to explore HTML positioning, updating, and OOP. 

Select a charcter, then an enemy. Click the "Attack" button to attack. After each attack your own attack power "AP" increases by 20%,
but the enemy's stays the same. 

The player always attacks first, try and figure out which order to attack to come out alive! 

It is possible to win with all characters, some are easier than others; ENJOY!
